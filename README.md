Title: Smart Plant Monitoring System

Programme: Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering

Institution: Munster Technological University

Hardware: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, HC-05 Bluetooth module, Micro SD Card Adapter, Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v2.0, DHT11 sensor, DS18B20 temperature probe, LCD1602I2C, 5V Relay, Water Pump, Passive PiezoBuzzer, LEDs.
          
Software: Arduino IDE, ThingSpeak server

IoT based Smart Plant Monitoring System compatible with Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and ThingSpeak server. The features contain sensors reading (soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, water temperature), SD card data logging, real-time online data analysis integrate with ThingSpeak, and auto-watering function. The system also incorporates fail-safe mechanism and faulty alarm system. This project applied advanced embedded 
programming, electrical wiring, automation principle, and critical thinking skills. The aim is to integrating smart technologies into agricultural such as improve plant care with automation, reduce manual labour and optimise water usage.

• A Flyback diode should be connected to the output of the Relay to prevent LCD flickering from current surge.

• A 470uF capacitor should be connected acrros the 5V and GND electricity path for decoupling purpose to ensure current stability.

I hope you like the project. Thank You!
